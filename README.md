#TSPHP-common

This repository contains the interfaces used by the [compiler](../tsphp "compiler") to integrate the different TSPHP components ([parser](../tsphp-parser "Parser component"), [type checker](tsphp-typechecker "type checker component") and [translator](../tsphp-translators-php54 "translator component")). In addition, it contains common classes like the AST representation TSPHPAst.

Please visit the [project's homepage](http://tsphp.tutteli.ch/) for more information.
